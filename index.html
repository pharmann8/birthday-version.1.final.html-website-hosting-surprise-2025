                <p><b>Happiest Birthday, my dearest Sabiha</b></p>

First and foremost, happy birthday again, my love‚ÄîI love you so very much. I have a little confession to make: my apologies, because I had originally planned to handwrite this letter for you, but I never had the time or opportunity to do it amidst the chaos of studying for our upcoming O-Levels and managing everything at home.

Instead, I poured my heart into creating something just as special (hopefully)‚Äî I created a whole ass webpage dedicated to you, for the first time!!! On it, I‚Äôve also made a video for you, which you can watch by clicking the "Click Me" button. 

I hope it brings a smile to your face. 

Enjoy it, my princess!

            <b>Chapter 1: Where It All Began</b>

April 15th, 2024.
Today feels like the perfect day to start something special‚Äîsomething for you, something for us. Sabiha, as I sit here and write this, I‚Äôve just sent you a simple text: ‚ÄúI love you, Sabiha.‚Äù Three small words, but they carry the entirety of my heart.
This moment marks the beginning of a ritual‚Äîone I‚Äôve decided to keep, month after month. Every 15th, I‚Äôll write a note, a message, or perhaps just those same three words, but each time, I‚Äôll try to capture more of what you mean to me. This ritual isn‚Äôt just a tradition; it‚Äôs a promise‚Äîa promise to remind you, repeatedly, endlessly, that my love for you is constant.
And so, I began:
April 15th: ‚ÄúAgain, damn, I love you, Sabiha.‚Äù
May 15th: ‚ÄúYour love is my favorite story, Sabiha, one I never want to stop writing. I love you, Sabiha.‚Äù
June 15th: ‚ÄúEvery moment with you feels like a little piece of forever, Sabiha. I love you, Sabiha.‚Äù
July 15th: ‚ÄúI could search the universe, Sabiha, and still find that my home is in your arms. I love you, Sabiha.‚Äù
August 15th: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the reason even my worst days end with a smile, Sabiha. I love you, Sabiha.‚Äù
September 15th: ‚ÄúWhen I think of you, Sabiha, baby, I swear I can hear the stars singing. I love you, Sabiha.‚Äù
October 15th: ‚ÄúLoving you, Sabiha, darling, feels like discovering a new kind of magic every day. I love you, Sabiha.‚Äù
November 15th: ‚ÄúIf my heart had a voice, Sabiha, my princess, it would whisper your name with every beat. I love you, Sabiha.‚Äù
December 15th: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the light I never knew I needed, Sabiha, my wife, and now I can‚Äôt imagine life without it. I love you, Sabiha.‚Äù
When I started this, I was eager‚Äîmaybe too eager‚Äîbut I knew that by the time your birthday came around, this letter would mean something special. You know, Sabiha, I‚Äôve always been the kind of person who starts early. Whether it‚Äôs studying, planning, or surprising you with tiny tokens of love, I like being prepared. But even I‚Äôll admit‚Äîstarting this on April 15th, an entire nine months before your birthday, might‚Äôve been a little excessive.
And yet, here we are.
Back then, on April 15th, I envisioned this moment: sitting down and weaving together the words that would eventually become the letter you‚Äôre holding now. I imagined pouring my heart out, reminiscing about every little thing that makes you extraordinary, and marking every milestone that led us here.
This isn‚Äôt just a letter, Sabiha. It‚Äôs a time capsule‚Äîa journey through the love we‚Äôve built, the memories we‚Äôve shared, and the future I dream of every single day. It‚Äôs me giving you a piece of myself, month by month, in a way that feels more real, more honest, more us than anything else could.
And you know why I chose to do this? Because I wanted to create something no one else could give you. Other couples might exchange grand gifts, plan elaborate surprises, or shower each other with extravagance, but I can‚Äôt do that‚Äînot in the way I want to, not yet. My parents are strict, our circumstances are limiting, and sometimes it feels like the world conspires to keep us from expressing our love as freely as we‚Äôd like.
So I thought, why not DIY this? Why not pour my soul into something handmade, homemade, crafted with love? Because, Sabiha, who doesn‚Äôt love something made entirely for them? This letter isn‚Äôt just words on paper; it‚Äôs my heart, my devotion, my everything. It‚Äôs all for you.
And with that, my ritual began. One text, one message, one declaration of love at a time.
This is just the start, Sabiha. There‚Äôs so much more to say, so much more to feel, and this is only Chapter 1. The story we‚Äôre writing together has no end, and I can‚Äôt wait to turn every page with you. 




            <b>Chapter 2: Theory of Evolution</b> 

If I close my eyes and let my mind wander back in time, I can trace the quiet evolution of us. 
If I calculate properly, I‚Äôve been there with you for three of your birthdays, counting this one. I‚Äôm not including 2022‚Äôs January 15th because, honestly, we weren‚Äôt even close back then. I don‚Äôt think you were even in Bangladesh at the time, and we were still just strangers brushing past each other‚Äôs lives, and I doubt that I even crossed your mind. But by the middle of 2022, something shifted‚Äîwe started talking as friends.
And then came January 15th, 2023. By then, so much had changed. We had become such good friends, and I had already fallen so deeply, so hopelessly, and irreversibly in love with you. I remember that night so vividly, wanting to be the first person to wish you a happy birthday at 12:00 am. I wanted it so badly, like it was the most important thing in the world. But I remember failing to do that, and I swore to myself, "Next year, I have to be the first one to wish her." It felt like a promise I had made to myself, a little piece of hope to hold onto.
But by January 15th, 2024, things were different again. We weren‚Äôt on the best terms, and it hurt‚Äîit hurt so much. Yet, even then, I couldn‚Äôt help but wish you happiness, even if it was from a distance. And now, as this birthday approaches, I can‚Äôt help but think about all these moments, about how time has woven our story with threads of love, longing, and growth.
Sabiha, back in 2022, before I even thought about dating you, all I wanted was to have you as a friend. A good, good friend. A friend I could talk to about anything and everything, a friend who would be my person‚Äîthe one I could call my ‚Äúdear diary‚Äù type of person. And vice versa; I wanted to be what Arraf was to you. And even if we couldn‚Äôt be friends, I still just wanted you. I wanted you to be the one who would check in on me when I was feeling low, the one who would ask me how my day was, the one who would make me feel like I wasn‚Äôt alone. I didn‚Äôt care about anyone else, sabiha. It was you. It was always you.
I wanted you to be someone who would let me know before they went offline, someone who would constantly keep me in the loop about where they were and what they were doing. I remember your 2023 birthday so clearly‚Äîyou told me you‚Äôd be going out that day, and even though it made me a little sad because we couldn‚Äôt talk, I still felt so relieved. Knowing you‚Äôd told me beforehand, knowing you cared enough to let me know‚Äîit made me feel safe. It was a strange kind of comfort, like the uncertainty of you not being there was washed away just because you said something.
I wanted you to be the person who would laugh and cry with me, someone who would text me with warmth and not the dryness I used to dread. I thought that maybe if we started dating, we could have the kind of connection I always dreamed of. The way we talk now, the way we sleep on call, the way we do everything together on video‚Äîthat is what I‚Äôve always wanted. Always. I wanted a love like this, a bond like this, and I wanted it with you.
You know, sabiha, before you, I didn‚Äôt know what it meant to love someone. I didn‚Äôt know what it meant to fall in love, to tell someone those three words and mean them with every fiber of my being. I didn‚Äôt even believe in love. But you‚Äîyou‚Äôve taught me. You‚Äôve shown me what it means to love and to be loved.
Before you, I never knew how beautiful and terrifying it could feel to give your whole heart to someone. But with you, it feels effortless. You‚Äôve shown me a kind of patience, a kind of kindness, and a loyalty that leaves me in awe every single day. You‚Äôve made me believe in things I didn‚Äôt think were possible.
You‚Äôve been my teacher, my muse, my home, and my greatest joy. And now, as I think about your upcoming birthday, I want you to know just how deeply you‚Äôve touched my life. Every moment we‚Äôve shared, every word we‚Äôve exchanged, every memory we‚Äôve made‚Äîthey‚Äôre all pieces of a story I never want to end. You are my story, sabiha. My favorite one.
This chapter of our story is one I‚Äôll cherish forever. But it‚Äôs only the beginning. There‚Äôs so much more to come, and I can‚Äôt wait to live every moment of it with you. 




            <b>Chapter 3: Metamorphosis</b>

If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned about love, it‚Äôs that it doesn‚Äôt happen all at once. It unfolds in moments‚Äîsome big, some small, but all of them meaningful. And with you, Sabiha, every moment has been a revelation, a step closer to understanding just how deeply I love you.
I often think back to those shy beginnings, how we started as nothing more than acquaintances and how, over time, we became something so much more. Do you remember those early days? I do. Every conversation felt like unwrapping a gift, every laugh, every lovey-dovey and cute-cringe conversations were melodies and moments I wanted to play on repeat.
I remember how nervous I felt during the first nights we stayed up talking, both, over texts and on call. There was this magic in the air, a tension that wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable but exhilarating. I could feel my heart race with every word you messaged and uttered, with every soft laugh that made its way through the call and over the screen. We were so cautious back then, like two people stepping onto a frozen lake, testing its strength with each step.
And yet, amidst all that caution, something extraordinary began to happen. We started to,  once again, open up to each other, peeling back the layers of who we were and of what we had become. I found myself telling you things I hadn‚Äôt told anyone else, sharing thoughts and dreams that had always felt too fragile to voice. And the more I shared, the more you listened‚Äînot just with your ears but with your heart.
You became my safe space, Sabiha. You became the person I wanted to tell everything to, from the silly details of my day to the fears that kept me awake at night. And, yes, I did just that. I told you everything. And in return, you let me in. You trusted me with your thoughts, your feelings, your vulnerabilities. That trust was‚Äîand still is‚Äîthe most precious gift you could have given me. It wasn‚Äôt long before those conversations turned into something deeper.
I still remember the first time I told you I loved you. It wasn‚Äôt planned. The words just spilled out, unpolished and raw, because I couldn‚Äôt keep them in anymore. And when you said it back, some time later, when you told me you loved me too, it felt like the world had finally clicked into place.
But it‚Äôs a shame: love, real love, isn‚Äôt just about the big declarations or the perfect moments. It‚Äôs about the quiet, everyday things. It‚Äôs about the way you smile when you see me, the way you laugh at my jokes even when they‚Äôre not that funny. It‚Äôs about the way you care for me, in all the little ways that matter most.
It‚Äôs the way you say goodnight, always making sure I feel loved before I fall asleep. It‚Äôs the way you remember the smallest details about me, the things I didn‚Äôt even realize I‚Äôd shared. It‚Äôs the way you support me, cheering me on when I need it most and grounding me when my thoughts get too loud.
Sabiha, loving you is like breathing‚Äînatural, necessary, and something I never want to stop doing, or quite frankly, something I can‚Äôt ever stop doing. I have always wanted to be the perfect boyfriend, you know? I thought that is only how I will be able to love with you all my might. However, you‚Äôve taught me that love isn‚Äôt about perfection; it‚Äôs about effort. It‚Äôs about showing up for each other, even on the hard days. It‚Äôs about self-control. It‚Äôs about listening with your heart and understanding with you soul. It‚Äôs about making the right sacrifices and commitments. And it‚Äôs about choosing each other, over and over again, no matter what.
You‚Äôve shown me that love is about growth, about becoming better not just for yourself but for the person you love. And because of you, I‚Äôve grown in ways I never thought possible. You‚Äôve made me kinder, more patient, more understanding. You‚Äôve made me want to be the best version of myself‚Äînot just for you, but because of you.
This journey we‚Äôre on, this beautiful, messy, incredible journey‚Äîit‚Äôs my favorite thing in the world. And as I sit here, reflecting on everything we‚Äôve shared, I can‚Äôt help but feel overwhelmed with gratitude. Gratitude for you, for us, for the love that has brought us here.
Sabiha, you are my greatest adventure, my truest love, my everything. And I can‚Äôt wait to see where this journey takes us next. Because with you by my side, I know it will be nothing short of extraordinary.




            <b>Chapter 4: Blooming Horizon</b>

Sabiha, when I close my eyes and think of the future, all I see is you. It‚Äôs a vision that feels so vivid, so tangible, it‚Äôs as if I could reach out and touch it. And this future, our future‚Äîit‚Äôs everything I‚Äôve ever dreamed of and more. It‚Äôs filled with light, laughter, and love, all centered around you, the most beautiful part of my life.
I imagine us waking up in a home we‚Äôve built together, sunlight streaming through the windows, your hair messy but still the most beautiful thing I‚Äôve ever seen. I‚Äôll make coffee‚Äîor at least attempt to‚Äîand maybe you‚Äôll tease me about how terrible I am at it, but you‚Äôll still drink it anyway because I made it for you. We‚Äôll sit together, starting our day in the quiet comfort of each other‚Äôs presence, no words needed, just the unspoken understanding that this is where we‚Äôre meant to be.
And when I think of us as parents, my heart feels so full it might burst. I can already see the way our kids will look up to you, the way their eyes will light up when you walk into the room. They‚Äôll know what I‚Äôve always known‚Äîthat you are magic, that you have this rare ability to make anyone feel like they‚Äôre the most important person in the world.
I can already picture the chaos and joy of family life‚Äîour kids running around the house, their laughter echoing in every corner. We‚Äôll team up for bedtime stories, you taking one kid, me taking the other, but inevitably ending up all together because neither they or us wil want to be apart. 
What about you, baby? Do you ever wonder what‚Äôs waiting for us out there? Because no matter what, I know it‚Äôs going to be worth it if it‚Äôs with you.
I've thought about that too, you know‚Äîhow we‚Äôll sit down one day, maybe on a cozy evening, with our kids curled up next to us, wide-eyed and curious, asking, ‚ÄúHow did you and Mom meet?‚Äù Honestly, just the thought of sharing our story with them gives me butterflies.
I‚Äôd start with the beginning‚Äîhow we were just two teenagers crossing paths, not even knowing how much we‚Äôd come to mean to each other. I'd tell them about those early days: how we slowly became friends, the inside jokes, the silly arguments, and the way my heart would race every time I saw you.
Then I‚Äôd share the moment it all changed‚Äîthe moment I realized it wasn‚Äôt just friendship; it was so much more. They‚Äôd be so surprised by the crazy plot twists. And then I‚Äôd tell them about April 4th, the day I gathered every bit of courage I had to tell you how I felt. How nervous I was, how I couldn‚Äôt find the right words, and how you still understood‚Äîbecause you always do.
And, of course, I‚Äôd tell them about the first ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù the shyness, the quiet moments on calls, the way we‚Äôd say those three little words like they held the whole universe between us. How those moments felt like magic‚Äîand how they still do. Because baby, our honeymoon is a never going to end.
I‚Äôd laugh a little, maybe tease you about how stubborn you can be, and then say, ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs your mom‚Äî hot, sexy, fierce, kind, and the most incredible person I‚Äôve ever met.‚Äù I‚Äôd tell them how you taught me what love really is‚Äîhow to be patient, how to grow, and how to be better every day.
And as we share all these moments, I hope they see what I see‚Äîa story of two people who weren‚Äôt perfect, but who chose each other over and over again. A story of love, resilience, and partnership. A story that made them possible.
And then, when they ask, ‚ÄúBut how did you know she was the one?‚Äù I‚Äôll just smile, look at you, and say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always known.‚Äù
And the best part about all of this: one day, instead of me quietly putting together these small little surprises, it‚Äôs going to be a whole different story. It‚Äôs going to be a well-coordinated, top-secret operation led by a very determined Daddy with a team of little co-conspirators‚Äîour kids.
We‚Äôll huddle together in whispers, plotting and planning the grandest surprise for their mama. They‚Äôll have all sorts of wild ideas, from balloons filling up the room to cakes with way too much frosting. And I‚Äôll make sure every single one of their ideas comes to life because, at the end of the day, it‚Äôs all for you.
You‚Äôll probably suspect something‚Äôs up, catching glimpses of us sneaking around, sharing sly smiles, and poorly hiding the glitter trails. But when the big moment comes, and you walk into a room filled with your favorite flowers, handwritten notes, and the most chaotic yet adorable decorations, it‚Äôll all be worth it just to see the smile on your face.
And as you stand there, overwhelmed by the love bursting from every corner, our kids will run up, tugging at your hands, shouting, ‚ÄúSurprise, Mommy!‚Äù And I‚Äôll be right there too, holding you close, thinking about how I got so lucky to have this little family with you. Because, Sabiha, whether it‚Äôs just me or me and our little dream team, making you happy will always be my favorite mission.
And yet, it‚Äôs not just the big moments I look forward to. It‚Äôs the small, everyday things that make me most excited about our future. Grocery shopping together, debating which snacks to get but always ending up with way too many. Watching movies late at night, me sneaking glances at you because I‚Äôd rather look at you than the screen. Sitting on the balcony during a rainy day, sharing a blanket and a cup of tea, the silence between us as comforting as your voice, as we peacefully watch the clouds cry.
Sabiha loves the rain.
Sabiha, you are my dream, my partner, my everything. And while the thought of growing old with you fills me with joy, I‚Äôm even more grateful for the journey we‚Äôll take to get there. I want to walk every step of life‚Äôs path with you‚Äîthrough the highs and the lows, the celebrations and the struggles. I want to be the one you lean on, the one who cheers you on, the one who loves you unconditionally, every single day.
One day, we‚Äôll look back on this moment‚Äîthis letter, this love, this life we‚Äôre building‚Äîand we‚Äôll smile. Because we‚Äôll know that everything we‚Äôve dreamed of, everything we‚Äôve worked towards, was worth it.
You are my beginning and my forever, Sabiha. And our future? It‚Äôs in bloom, just like us.




            <b>Chapter 5: Weight of Desire</b>

Jealousy, Sabiha‚Äîan emotion so heavy, so consuming, yet so deeply human. I know it has a way of creeping into your thoughts sometimes, especially when you think about my past relationships. I know those memories, though buried for me, still rise like ghosts for you, casting shadows that make your heart ache. And while I can‚Äôt erase the past, I can tell you this: your feelings are valid. They are understood. They are accepted.
Sabiha, jealousy doesn‚Äôt scare me. Not yours. Not when it comes from a place of love and vulnerability. It doesn‚Äôt make you weaker in my eyes‚Äîit makes you more human, more beautiful. It‚Äôs proof of how deeply you care, how fiercely you love, and how much you want to protect what we have. And that, my darling, is something I admire about you.
I know it‚Äôs not easy. I know the weight of it sometimes feels unbearable, the questions it forces you to ask yourself and me, the doubts it plants like unwelcome seeds. I see it in your eyes when those thoughts take hold, and it breaks my heart. Not because I feel burdened by your jealousy, but because I hate that you ever feel that kind of pain.
You‚Äôve told me about these feelings before, and every time, I‚Äôve tried to reassure you. But let me say it again, as clearly and as loudly as I can: you are my present, my future, my forever. My past doesn‚Äôt hold a candle to the light you bring into my life. Those memories are faded photographs, distant echoes of a time before I even knew what real love was.
What we have now? It‚Äôs everything. You are everything. You‚Äôre the one I want to wake up to, the one I want to laugh with, cry with, grow old with. No one else even comes close.
I‚Äôve never felt this kind of security, this kind of peace, with anyone else. You‚Äôve given me a love that feels steady and unwavering, a love that makes me want to be the best version of myself every single day. And I hope you know that you‚Äôve never given me any reason to doubt you. Not once. Not ever.
I want you to feel that same security with me, Sabiha. I want you to know, deep down in your soul, that my heart belongs to you and only you. That every word I write, every promise I make, every moment we share‚Äîit‚Äôs all for you.
I don‚Äôt just love you because you‚Äôre beautiful, though you are breathtaking. I don‚Äôt just love you because of the way you love me, though it‚Äôs the greatest gift I‚Äôve ever received. I love you for you‚Äîfor your mind, your heart, your soul, your flaws, your fears, your everything.
Jealousy might weigh on you, but I hope this love we share lifts you higher. I hope it reminds you that you are enough, more than enough. You are my everything, Sabiha. And no ghost of the past could ever take that away.
And while I can‚Äôt rewrite the past, I promise to build a future with you that‚Äôs so full of love, joy, and security that it overshadows anything that came before. You are my first real love, sabiha. You‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs shown me what it means to love deeply and completely. No one else even comes close.
So if those thoughts creep in, if the shadows of the past try to make their way into your heart, please let me be there for you. Talk to me. Let me remind you that you‚Äôre the one I choose, every single day, in every single way. And even if you don‚Äôt bring it up, know that I‚Äôm always thinking of ways to make you feel as secure and cherished as you truly deserve to feel.
So let the weight of jealousy come if it must, but know that you don‚Äôt have to carry it alone. I‚Äôm here, always, ready to share the burden, ready to remind you that you are the love of my life. The only one. The forever one.
You, Sabiha, are the woman I‚Äôll choose every day for the rest of my damn life. And no past, no doubt, no fleeting shadow could ever change that.
Furthermore, jealousy, Sabiha‚Äîit‚Äôs not just something I understand in you, it‚Äôs something I feel, too. Fiercely. Unapologetically. Not because I don‚Äôt trust you, but because the depth of my love for you has a way of making everything and everyone else seem like a threat. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs one of your closest friends, a random guy in school, a girl, or even a cat purring at your feet‚Äîevery single being that gets even a sliver of your attention makes me jealous in a way I can‚Äôt fully explain.
Do you know what it feels like to be consumed by this? To see someone else laugh at your jokes or catch a glimpse of the smile that‚Äôs meant to be mine? It‚Äôs maddening. It‚Äôs as if my heart is waging war against my rationality. I know you‚Äôre loyal. I know you‚Äôre mine. But jealousy doesn‚Äôt listen to reason. It feeds off love, and my love for you is endless, overflowing, unstoppable.
I get jealous of my own friends when they talk to you. The way they make you laugh or the casual ease with which they exist around you‚Äîit makes my chest tighten. And even your cousins, who I know are family, make me feel like there‚Äôs a little competition happening in my head. I‚Äôm jealous of every single person who gets to experience you, even if it‚Äôs just for a moment.
It‚Äôs not just because I love you; it‚Äôs because I want all of you. Every smile, every laugh, every moment. I want to be the one you turn to, the one who gets to hear your thoughts, see your smile, feel your presence. And the thought that anyone else gets even a fraction of what I have? It kills me.
But this jealousy isn‚Äôt rooted in doubt. It‚Äôs rooted in the sheer intensity of my love for you. You are so precious to me, so irreplaceable, that the idea of anyone else sharing in the magic of you feels unbearable. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm standing in a room full of treasures, knowing you are the rarest gem of all, and I can‚Äôt bear the thought of anyone else admiring what‚Äôs mine.
And yet, I try to remind myself that this feeling is a testament to how much I adore you. It‚Äôs not about control or insecurity‚Äîit‚Äôs about how deeply intertwined my heart has become with yours. You are my universe, So yes, I get jealous. I get jealous of everyone who has ever been lucky enough to share a moment with you, and I get jealous of everyone who ever will.
But even in my jealousy, I know this: you‚Äôve chosen me. You‚Äôve given me a love so deep and so real that it feels like a dream. You‚Äôve shown me that no matter who else may be around, it‚Äôs me you‚Äôve chosen to share your life with. And for that, I am endlessly grateful.
So if you ever catch me looking at you a little too intently, or if I ask one too many questions about who you were talking to or why they made you laugh, know that it all comes from a place of love. A place of wanting to be your everything, because you are already mine.
You are my Sabiha. My light, my love, my forever. And though jealousy may sometimes weigh on my heart, it‚Äôs a small price to pay for the privilege of loving you. Because you, my darling, are worth every single pang of jealousy, every single ache of longing. You are my world, and I wouldn‚Äôt trade this love for anything.




            <b>Chapter 6: Love That Teaches</b>

Sabiha, if I were to map out everything I‚Äôve learned in life, the most profound lessons would all lead back to you. Loving you has been my greatest education‚Äîone that has reshaped my heart, my mind, and my very understanding of the world.
Before you, I didn‚Äôt truly grasp what it meant to love someone or to be loved in return. I didn‚Äôt understand the depth, the patience, or the selflessness it required. Love always seemed like an abstract idea, something people talked about but never something I felt grounded in. But with you, it‚Äôs all so different. You‚Äôve shown me a love that is raw, unfiltered, and impossibly beautiful.
Through you, I‚Äôve learned the value of vulnerability. You‚Äôve taught me that it‚Äôs okay to let my guard down, to let someone in completely. You‚Äôve seen parts of me that I once kept hidden from the world, and instead of running away, you held me closer. You‚Äôve made me feel seen and understood in ways I never thought possible, and for that, I will always be grateful.
You‚Äôve also taught me the beauty of patience. Sabiha, you have this way of holding space for people, of allowing them to grow and evolve at their own pace. With you, I‚Äôve learned that love isn‚Äôt about rushing or demanding‚Äîit‚Äôs about waiting, trusting, and letting things unfold naturally. You‚Äôve shown me that real love doesn‚Äôt try to fix or change someone; it simply supports them as they become the best version of themselves.
And then there‚Äôs your kindness, a lesson in itself. You love with such an open and giving heart, and it inspires me every day to be better‚Äînot just for you, but for everyone around me. Your empathy, your compassion, your ability to care so deeply‚Äîit‚Äôs taught me what it means to truly connect with someone, to be there for them in every sense of the word.
Even in moments of jealousy or doubt, you‚Äôve taught me about resilience and reassurance. Your retroactive jealousy, something that might make others falter, has only deepened my understanding of love. You‚Äôve shown me how to navigate those moments with honesty and tenderness, how to address insecurities without letting them define us. In doing so, you‚Äôve taught me that love is not about perfection‚Äîit‚Äôs about effort, about showing up even when it‚Äôs hard.
And, Sabiha, you‚Äôve taught me what it means to dream. Before you, my visions of the future were hazy and uncertain. But with you, they‚Äôve taken on a vivid clarity. You‚Äôve taught me to hope, to imagine, to believe in a life filled with joy, laughter, and endless possibilities. You‚Äôve given me a reason to look forward, a reason to build and strive and grow.
Your beauty, both inside and out, is a lesson in itself. I‚Äôve learned to see the world differently through your eyes, to find magic in the mundane and light in the darkest corners. You‚Äôve shown me that love isn‚Äôt just about grand gestures or perfect moments‚Äîit‚Äôs about the little things. It‚Äôs about the way you laugh, the way you say my name, the way you just exist and make everything around you brighter.
Sabiha, this love we share‚Äîit teaches me something new every single day. It‚Äôs not always easy, and it‚Äôs not always perfect, but it‚Äôs real. It‚Äôs the kind of love that changes you, that makes you want to be better, that makes you grateful just to be alive and to share this life with someone so incredible.
You are my greatest teacher, my sweetest lesson, and my most cherished truth. And for that, I love you more than words could ever express. 




            <b>Chapter 7: Minute and Mundane</b>

Sabiha, have you ever noticed how love doesn‚Äôt just bloom in grand gestures or monumental moments? Instead, it thrives in the tiniest, most unassuming details‚Äîthe small things that most people might overlook but that mean everything to someone who truly loves you.
For me, the symphony of my love for you plays in the small, quiet moments. It‚Äôs in the way you say "hehehe" when something genuinely amuses you, or the way you absentmindedly type out "awh," "awe," or "aww," each one laced with a softness that feels like a gentle hug across the screen. It‚Äôs the "lalala" and "balalala" you let slip into our conversations when you‚Äôre playful, and that little "ooo" when something catches your attention‚Äîit‚Äôs such a simple sound, but it‚Äôs you, and that makes it extraordinary.
Even the smallest texts‚Äî"okay," "hm," or a single emoji‚Äîcarry so much weight because they come from you. Every little thing you say, every random expression, feels so special, so uniquely you. They‚Äôre not just words to me; they‚Äôre pieces of you, fragments of your soul that you share with me, and I cherish them like treasures.
And forget everything else‚Äîwhen you say you like me, even in the driest tone, even with the simplest words, my entire world stops. Every single time you type those three words, "I love you," it feels like the entire universe conspires to remind me that I am, without a doubt, the luckiest man alive. It‚Äôs not just a phrase to me‚Äîit‚Äôs a galaxy of emotions packed into a few keystrokes. It brightens my day, fills my heart, and lightens my soul. Every worry, every stress, every doubt just melts away because you said it‚Äîbecause those words came from you.
But it‚Äôs not just your words; it‚Äôs the way you are. The way you call me "pakhi," the way your voice softens when you‚Äôre being sweet, the way you laugh‚Äîit all resonates in my heart like the melody of a favorite song, one I never want to end. Even when you tease me or say something silly, I hold onto it like the most valuable treasure. Every "hehehe," every random "awww" or "ooo," stays with me long after our conversations end, playing like a tune I can‚Äôt‚Äîand don‚Äôt want to‚Äîforget.
And oh, the compliments. Sabiha, every single time you say something nice about me‚Äîwhen you call me cute, sweet, handsome, hot, perfect or whatever‚Äîit‚Äôs like I‚Äôm floating. It‚Äôs not just about how I look or sound; it‚Äôs the ones about who I am. The way you see me, the way you understand me‚Äîit‚Äôs the kind of validation that sinks deep into my soul and replays over and over, especially when I‚Äôm feeling down.
Even your smallest actions speak volumes. The way you turn on your camera during calls, even when you don‚Äôt feel your best, just because you know it makes me happy. The way you smile, even through the screen, and suddenly the distance between us doesn‚Äôt feel so vast. The way you hold my hand when we‚Äôre together, as if to say, "I‚Äôm here, and I‚Äôm not letting go." It‚Äôs in the little ways you show up for me, time and time again, effortlessly turning ordinary moments into something extraordinary.
You‚Äôve shown me that love isn‚Äôt found just in the grand, dramatic gestures‚Äîit‚Äôs in the quiet, the mundane, the everyday. It‚Äôs in the way you say my name, the way you share your thoughts, the way you exist simply and beautifully as you. And more than anything, it‚Äôs in the way you inspire me to notice the little things, to find joy in the details, to appreciate life as it happens.
So yeah, Sabiha, every little thing you say and do‚Äîeven the random "awws," "lalalas," and "ooos"‚Äîmakes my day, my night, my everything. You‚Äôve turned my world into something brighter, more beautiful, more alive. And I‚Äôll never stop appreciating every word, every sound, every piece of you that you choose to share with me. Because in those little moments, I am reminded, again and again, that I‚Äôm the luckiest man alive.
So, here‚Äôs to the symphony of small things. To every "hehehe," every "aww," every smile, every touch, every glance. To all the little moments that make up this big, beautiful love we share. To you, Sabiha‚Äîthe one who turns the smallest things into the grandest gestures.
I love you for all of it. For the grand and the tiny, the loud and the quiet, the seen and the unseen. I love you for the way you make my world feel whole, one small, precious moment at a time.




            <b>Chapter 8: Hundred and Sixty Ways</b> 

Sabiha, how do you tell someone you love them in a way that feels infinite? In a way that transcends time, space, and even the limits of language itself? For you, I wanted to try‚Äîbecause ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù isn‚Äôt just a phrase; it‚Äôs a declaration, a celebration, a promise. 
Sabiha, today feels like the perfect moment to remind you of something you already know‚Äîhow endlessly and deeply I love you. But saying it in just one language doesn‚Äôt feel like enough. Because today, you‚Äôre turning 16, and what better way to celebrate your beautiful journey into 16 years of life than by expressing my love for you in 160 different languages.

So, my darling, my beautiful Sabiha, on this day that marks your 16 years of life, I give you these 160  ways to say I love you. Every phrase is a testament to the infinity of my love for you. You are my everything in every language, every dialect, and every whisper of this universe. Always remember, in every way possible and beyond words, I love you.  
And the list goes on and on. These words are my tribute to you, a reflection of how universal and boundless my love for you is. Because, Sabiha, if love were a language, you‚Äôd be my native tongue. You‚Äôd be the words I dream in, the poetry I breathe, the sentences I live by.
But even with all these languages at my disposal, I often feel like no words could ever fully capture the way I feel about you. How do you describe the way my heart races when I see you smile? How do you put into words the comfort of hearing your voice, the warmth of your laugh, the way the world feels softer and brighter when you‚Äôre around?
Each time I tell you ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù it carries the weight of everything I‚Äôve ever felt for you, everything I will ever feel. It‚Äôs not just a statement‚Äîit‚Äôs a universe of emotions, memories, dreams, and hopes all condensed into three little words.
And yet, sometimes, even those three words don‚Äôt feel like enough. That‚Äôs why I find myself writing you letters, sending you messages, and creating moments like this‚Äîbecause no matter how many times I say it, I want you to hear it again and again. I want you to know it, to feel it, to never doubt for even a second how much you mean to me.
Sabiha, you‚Äôre my world. You‚Äôre the song my heart sings, the story my soul writes, and the language my love speaks. Across every border, every culture, every tongue‚Äîmy love for you remains the same. Infinite, boundless, and uniquely yours.
So here‚Äôs to ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù in every way it can be said. But most importantly, here‚Äôs to ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù in the way I say it to you‚Äîwith every beat of my heart, with every thought in my mind, with every piece of my soul. Always and forever, I love you.




            <b>Chapter 9: Cosmos and Cornea</b>

Sabiha, every time I look into your eyes, it feels as though I am staring into a universe crafted just for me‚Äîa boundless expanse of beauty, mystery, and light. Your eyes hold galaxies, endless and eternal, drawing me in and wrapping me in their quiet brilliance. They are not just windows to your soul; they are constellations of everything I have ever sought in this life.
Do you know what it feels like to be lost and found at the same time? That‚Äôs what happens every time I meet your gaze. In those moments, the world fades away. The noise, the chaos, the doubts‚Äîthey all dissolve into the stillness of your eyes. And in that stillness, I find peace. I find home.
But it‚Äôs not just the way your eyes look. It‚Äôs what they hold. Your kindness, your strength, your vulnerability‚Äîthey all shine through, like stars lighting up the darkest skies. Your eyes speak volumes, even in silence. They tell me of your love, your fears, your dreams. They tell me stories of a soul so beautiful, so profound, that I can‚Äôt help but be mesmerized.
There‚Äôs a softness to the way you look at me sometimes, a tenderness that makes me feel like the most cherished person in the world. And then there are those playful glances, the ones that make me laugh, that remind me of how lucky I am to share these little moments with you. Every look is a gift, a reminder of just how extraordinary you are.
Sabiha, you are the most beautiful person I have ever laid my eyes on. From the delicate curve of your thick eyebrows to the way your long lashes frame those mesmerizing eyes, everything about you is perfection. Your beauty is effortless, natural, breathtaking. It‚Äôs the kind of beauty that doesn‚Äôt just catch the eye but captures the heart.
But beyond the physical, there‚Äôs a light in your eyes that is entirely your own. It‚Äôs a reflection of the person you are‚Äîthe kind, thoughtful, passionate soul who has completely changed my life. Your eyes remind me of your strength, of how you‚Äôve faced challenges and grown into someone so resilient, so admirable.
And then there‚Äôs the way your eyes light up when you‚Äôre happy, when you‚Äôre excited, when you‚Äôre laughing. It‚Äôs like the whole world brightens with you. I live for those moments, Sabiha. I live for the sparkle in your eyes when you‚Äôre talking about something you love, for the glow that appears when you‚Äôre with the people you care about.
I remember the first time I truly looked into your eyes, really looked. It was as though time stopped. In that moment, I knew I had found something extraordinary. I knew I had found you. And now, every time our eyes meet, it feels like a silent promise‚Äîa promise of love, of loyalty, of forever.
You once told me that you don‚Äôt fully understand why I love you, that you can‚Äôt always comprehend the depth of my feelings. Sabiha, if you could see yourself through my eyes, you would never doubt it. You would see the woman who has given me a love so profound, so all-encompassing, that it feels like a miracle.
Your eyes hold a universe, Sabiha‚Äîa universe I want to explore for the rest of my life. They are my compass, my anchor, my everything. And as I look into them, I know, without a doubt, that I have found the greatest treasure this world could ever offer.
You are my universe, Sabiha. And every time I see you, every time I look into your eyes, I fall in love all over again.




            <b>Chapter 10: Touch</b>

Sabiha, every time your skin brushes against mine, it feels like the universe pauses, holding its breath to witness something sacred. Your touch is a language, one that speaks directly to my soul, filling the spaces where words often fall short. It‚Äôs not just the physical sensation; it‚Äôs the emotions, the connection, the warmth that come with it.
I know we haven‚Äôt shared as many physical moments as other couples might have. We haven‚Äôt had the kisses, the passionate embraces, or even the casual physical closeness that others take for granted. But, baby, that doesn‚Äôt make what we have any less meaningful. If anything, it makes every single touch, every single moment, even more special.
I think back to the times we held hands‚Äîthose fleeting seconds when your fingers intertwined with mine. Do you remember the first time we did? My heart was racing so fast I could barely breathe. It wasn‚Äôt just about holding hands; it was about holding a piece of you, feeling your presence in a way that words could never express.
And the hugs, Sabiha‚Äîthose hugs. Each one is a memory etched into my heart. I can still feel the way your arms wrapped around me, the warmth of your body pressed against mine, the way your embrace felt like home. I remember the first time you hugged me, how I froze for a second because I couldn‚Äôt believe it was real. I couldn‚Äôt believe someone as extraordinary as you would share that moment with me.
Then there are those forehead kisses‚Äîthose gentle, fleeting gestures that carry so much meaning. Every time I kiss your forehead, it‚Äôs like my soul is whispering, ‚ÄúI love you, I cherish you, I‚Äôm here for you.‚Äù It‚Äôs my way of saying all the things I feel but can‚Äôt put into words. And every time you let me kiss your forehead, it feels like you‚Äôre letting me into your world, trusting me with a piece of your heart.
Sabiha, every touch with you feels like magic, like I‚Äôm holding something sacred. The softness of your skin, the curves of your body‚Äîevery
 time my hands trace your curves, every time I feel the softness of your skin, I‚Äôm reminded of just how lucky I am. The thought that you‚Äôre letting me, of all people, be this close to you‚Äîit‚Äôs humbling, and it‚Äôs beautiful. It makes me feel like the luckiest man alive.
I know I get shy sometimes, and honestly, I‚Äôm still in disbelief that I get to experience this with you. But that shyness is paired with so much joy, baby. Joy because it‚Äôs you. Because your body, your warmth, your everything‚Äîit feels like a gift. And it‚Äôs not just the physical‚Äîit‚Äôs the way you make me feel, like I‚Äôm holding something sacred.
And when you touch me back‚Äîwhen your hands graze my face, trace my chest, my arms, even my groin‚Äîit‚Äôs like electricity surging through me. It‚Äôs not just about desire; it‚Äôs the way you make me feel seen, wanted, and connected in the most intimate way. Every moment, every touch, reminds me just how much I love you, and it leaves me in awe of the magic we share.
Even the smallest touches mean the world to me. The way your hand lingers on mine when you pass something to me, the way your shoulder brushes against mine when we sit close together, the way your fingers absentmindedly play with my sleeve‚Äîit all matters. It all reminds me that you‚Äôre real, that you‚Äôre here, that we‚Äôre connected in a way that goes beyond the physical.
Sabiha, every touch from you is a blessing. Every moment we‚Äôve shared, no matter how small or fleeting, is a treasure I hold close to my heart. You make me feel like the luckiest man alive, not because of the number of physical moments we‚Äôve had, but because of the depth and meaning behind each one.
I don‚Äôt need grand gestures or constant physical affection to feel loved by you. Just seeing you turn on your camera during a call, just hearing your voice, just knowing that you‚Äôre there‚Äîit‚Äôs enough. It‚Äôs more than enough. But when you do touch me, when you let me hold you or hug you, it feels like the entire universe aligns in that moment, like everything is exactly as it should be.
I love the way you make even the smallest moments feel monumental. You could simply brush a strand of hair away from your face, and I‚Äôd find myself captivated, wishing I could be the one to do it for you. Your presence alone is enough to make my heart race, but your touch‚Äîit‚Äôs like nothing else in the world.
Sabiha, I love you in every way possible. I love the way you think, the way you speak, the way you care. But there‚Äôs something uniquely magical about the way you touch. It‚Äôs not just physical; it‚Äôs emotional, spiritual, profound.
You‚Äôve given me a love so pure, so beautiful, that it feels like a gift with every single touch. And one day, I know we‚Äôll share even more of those moments. We‚Äôll have the hugs that last longer, the kisses that linger, the kind of closeness that speaks volumes without a single word.
Until then, I‚Äôll cherish every single moment we‚Äôve already had and every single one yet to come. Because with you, even the smallest touch holds the power to move mountains, to heal wounds, to create memories that will last a lifetime.




            <b>Chapter 11: Beyond Touch</b>

Sabiha, my love, there are moments when words fail me, when the emotions I feel for you swell so deeply within me that I struggle to put them into coherent thoughts. Loving you isn‚Äôt just a feeling‚Äîit‚Äôs a whole universe of experiences, sensations, and depths that I never thought I was capable of exploring.
There‚Äôs this unexplainable pull you have on my soul, this gravity that keeps me tethered to you in the most beautiful way. It‚Äôs not just about the happiness you bring me, though that‚Äôs immeasurable‚Äîit‚Äôs about the way you‚Äôve taught me to feel so profoundly, so completely. With you, emotions aren‚Äôt just fleeting moments; they‚Äôre layered, intricate, and alive.
Every time I look into your eyes, I‚Äôm met with a depth I can‚Äôt begin to describe. Your gaze holds entire galaxies, Sabiha, and when you look at me, it feels like you‚Äôre seeing every part of me‚Äîmy heart, my soul, and even the parts of myself I didn‚Äôt know existed. It‚Äôs a feeling that‚Äôs both grounding and overwhelming, like standing on the edge of the ocean, knowing it‚Äôs vast and endless, yet feeling safe because I‚Äôm with you.
I feel your love in the quiet moments, in the way you listen when I speak, in the way you laugh at my dumb jokes, and in the way you care for me so selflessly. You may not always say it, but I feel it in the warmth of your touch, in the softness of your voice, and in the little things you do that make my life so much brighter.
You once told me that you don‚Äôt always understand why you love me, that it‚Äôs this inexplicable feeling you can‚Äôt put into words. And, Sabiha, I get it now because I feel the same way about you. How do you describe something so vast, so consuming, and so pure? How do you explain the way your heart swells at the thought of someone, the way their presence feels like both home and adventure?
Loving you has taught me so much, Sabiha. It‚Äôs taught me to be patient, to be kind, to be vulnerable. It‚Äôs taught me that love isn‚Äôt just about grand gestures or poetic words‚Äîit‚Äôs in the small, everyday things. It‚Äôs in the way you remember my favorite things, the way you notice when I‚Äôm feeling off, and the way you always find a way to make me smile, even on my worst days.
You‚Äôve made me feel emotions I didn‚Äôt know I was capable of. The joy I feel when I‚Äôm with you, the ache I feel when we‚Äôre apart, the pride I feel in your successes, and the deep, unwavering love I feel for you‚Äîit‚Äôs all because of you. You‚Äôve opened up a part of my heart that I didn‚Äôt even know was locked away, and for that, I‚Äôm eternally grateful.
I remember the times I‚Äôve cried tears of joy because of you, the way my heart swells to the point where it feels like it might burst. It‚Äôs not just the big moments, Sabiha‚Äîit‚Äôs the little things. It‚Äôs the way you say my name, the way you look at me, and the way you make me feel like I‚Äôm the most important person in the world.
There‚Äôs a quote by Rainer Maria Rilke that says, ‚ÄúFor one human being to love another: that is perhaps the most difficult of all our tasks, the ultimate, the last test and proof, the work for which all other work is but preparation.‚Äù And, Sabiha, loving you feels like the most natural thing in the world, but also the most profound. It feels like the culmination of everything I‚Äôve ever done, every choice I‚Äôve ever made, leading me to you.
I don‚Äôt just love you, Sabiha‚ÄîI feel you. I feel your presence in everything I do, in every thought I have. I feel your warmth in the sunlight, your laughter in the breeze, and your love in every beat of my heart. You are the thread that ties everything in my life together, the constant that keeps me grounded, and the dream that keeps me reaching for more.
You are my depth, my everything. You‚Äôve shown me that emotions aren‚Äôt something to fear but something to embrace. You‚Äôve taught me that love is worth every risk, every challenge, and every moment of vulnerability. With you, I‚Äôve found a depth of emotion that I never knew was possible, and I wouldn‚Äôt trade it for anything in the world.
Sabiha, you are my heart, my soul, and the deepest part of me. You are the emotion I carry in every breath, the love I hold in every beat of my heart, and the person who makes my life worth living. For all of this, and so much more, I love you endlessly.




            <b>Chapter 12: Love That Blames</b>

Sabiha, there‚Äôs a funny thing about love‚Äîtrue, consuming love. It demands to be felt in every fiber of your being, and it refuses to follow the rules of logic or reason. And with that love comes blame, but not the kind that hurts. No, this blame is different. It‚Äôs the kind of blame that makes me smile even when I‚Äôm overwhelmed, the kind that makes me shake my head at how utterly helpless I am when it comes to you.
I blame you for everything, and I always will. I blame you for the way my heart skips a beat every time I hear your voice. I blame you for making my days brighter just by showing up at school. I blame you for turning my world upside down in the best possible way. It‚Äôs your fault that I can‚Äôt look at the stars without thinking about the galaxies in your eyes, that every love song now feels like it was written for us.
I blame you for making me the happiest man alive. I blame you for making me laugh at the stupidest things, for making me cry tears of joy just by being you. It‚Äôs all your fault, Sabiha. You‚Äôve ruined me in the most beautiful way, and I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.
You‚Äôve turned me into someone who sees the world differently, someone who can‚Äôt help but find beauty in every little thing because it reminds me of you. A random sunset isn‚Äôt just a sunset anymore; it‚Äôs a reminder of the warmth you bring into my life. The sound of laughter isn‚Äôt just a sound; it‚Äôs a memory of how you light up my world with yours.
And then there‚Äôs the blame that comes with missing you. I blame you for the ache in my chest when we‚Äôre apart, for the way time drags when you‚Äôre not around. It‚Äôs your fault that I long for you so deeply, that even the smallest moment without you feels like an eternity.
But, baby, this blame isn‚Äôt a burden‚Äîit‚Äôs a blessing. It‚Äôs a constant reminder of how much you mean to me, of how deeply you‚Äôve woven yourself into every corner of my life. It‚Äôs proof that my love for you isn‚Äôt just skin-deep; it‚Äôs rooted in the very core of who I am.
I blame you for giving me a love so profound that it changes everything. I blame you for making me dream of a future where it‚Äôs just us, building a life together, sharing every triumph and weathering every storm. I blame you for making me want things I never thought I‚Äôd want, for making me believe in things I never thought I‚Äôd believe in.
Sabiha, you‚Äôve given me a love that blames in the best way possible. A love that doesn‚Äôt seek to control or diminish but instead amplifies every joy, every moment, every feeling. A love that blames you for all the happiness, the hope, the wonder you‚Äôve brought into my life.
So yes, I‚Äôll always blame you‚Äîfor every smile, every laugh, every moment of pure bliss. I‚Äôll blame you for making me believe in love, for showing me what it truly means to care for someone so deeply that it feels like your heart might burst.
And, my love, I‚Äôll keep blaming you for the rest of my life. Because if being this happy, this fulfilled, this in love is anyone‚Äôs fault, it‚Äôs yours. And I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing.




            <b>Chapter 13: Oaths</b>

Sabiha, my sweetest love, promises often feel like fragile threads, words spoken into the wind, but with you, they are the very foundation of everything I hold sacred. Each promise I make to you is unshakable, a vow written not just in words but in every beat of my heart. They are boundless, infinite, and they stretch across every imaginable horizon of our future.
I promise you, Sabiha, that I will marry you. It doesn‚Äôt matter how far the future takes us, or how uncertain the journey might be. I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre halfway across the world or if life has thrown challenges our way that seem insurmountable‚ÄîI will find you. I will stand before you, unwavering in my love, and I will make you mine forever.
It‚Äôs not just about the grand gestures, though, Sabiha. My promises live in the quiet moments too. I promise to always ask, ‚ÄúHow was your day?‚Äù because your happiness will forever be my priority. I promise to tell you, ‚ÄúCall me when you‚Äôre home,‚Äù because your safety will always be at the forefront of my mind. I promise to make you coffee on cold mornings, to press your head when you‚Äôre tired, to save you food when I find something delicious, and to ask for your opinion on even the smallest decisions because your voice will always matter to me.
One day, I‚Äôll hold your hand as we sit with our kids, helping them craft birthday cards for their mama, whispering to them about how much I adore you. Together, we‚Äôll plan surprises so grand they‚Äôll leave you speechless. I promise to create a life with you where every single day feels like a celebration of the love we share.
I promise to never give up on you, no matter what. Even if there are days when you might feel unworthy or unsure, I will remind you, again and again, of the incredible person you are. I‚Äôll be there, holding you through every storm, celebrating every victory, and standing by your side through every challenge.
Sabiha, I promise to always look at you the way I do now‚Äîwith wonder, with admiration, with a love so overwhelming it feels almost impossible to contain. I promise to cherish every part of you, from your radiant smile to the way you wrinkle your nose when you laugh, from your brilliant mind to your compassionate heart.
I promise to build a home with you, not just a physical one, but a home in every sense of the word‚Äîa place where you feel safe, loved, and cherished. I promise to be your partner in everything, to share your dreams and to dream with you, to support you through every step of your journey, and to celebrate every achievement, big or small.
And if life ever becomes too heavy, I promise to carry that weight with you, to lighten your burden however I can. I promise to make you laugh when you feel like crying, to hold you when words aren‚Äôt enough, and to remind you every single day of just how deeply you are loved.
Sabiha, I promise to love you through every season of life. Through the springtimes of joy and growth, through the summers of laughter and warmth, through the autumns of change and reflection, and even through the winters of hardship and challenge. My love for you isn‚Äôt conditional; it‚Äôs steadfast and eternal, a love that will endure through every twist and turn life throws our way.
I promise to be the husband you deserve, the partner you can always count on. I promise to give you the life you‚Äôve always dreamed of, to make you feel like the queen you are, and to love you with every fiber of my being for as long as I live.
My promises to you, Sabiha, are boundless because my love for you knows no limits. And even if I were to spend a thousand lifetimes trying to show you just how much you mean to me, it still wouldn‚Äôt be enough. You are my everything, Sabiha, and I am yours, now and forever.




            <b>Chapter 14: Tomorrow</b>

Sabiha, my love, when I think of tomorrow, it‚Äôs never a vague blur or an uncertain possibility‚Äîit‚Äôs vivid, full of color, and unmistakably centered around you. My dreams for the future are dreams of us, of building a life together that feels as magical and grounding as the love we share right now.
I often wonder what it‚Äôll be like to wake up next to you every morning. No alarms from separate devices, no hurried goodbyes over texts. Just us, tangled in the sheets, the morning sunlight pouring through the window, and your soft breathing beside me. I imagine starting my day with you, your sleepy smile being the first thing I see, your warmth the first thing I feel. And, Sabiha, I promise you this: every single morning, I‚Äôll kiss you on your forehead, your cheeks, and your lips, just to remind you how much I adore you.
And Sabiha, it‚Äôs not just the mornings I dream of‚Äîit‚Äôs the nights, too. When the world slows down and there‚Äôs nothing but you and me. I imagine holding you close, feeling your skin against mine, and losing myself in the rhythm of our love. I crave the way our passion will fill the spaces between us, unspoken words melting into the heat of our bodies. Every night, I want to worship you‚Äîto make you feel cherished, loved, and desired in ways only I can. I dream of kissing every inch of you, of pulling you closer until we are completely lost in each other. And even after the fire subsides, I‚Äôll hold you in my arms, our hearts beating as one, your soft breaths on my chest reminding me that this‚Äîyou‚Äîis my home.
There are so many dreams tied to our future, dreams that I keep close to my heart and nurture with every passing day. I imagine our first home, Sabiha‚Äîhow we‚Äôll pick out the furniture together, argue about the curtains, and laugh over our differing tastes. I imagine the walls filled with pictures of us‚Äîsnapshots of our happiest moments, the laughter frozen in time, and little corners that feel like home simply because you‚Äôre in them.
I dream of our wedding day, where I‚Äôll be standing at the end of the aisle, watching you walk toward me. In that moment, Sabiha, I know the world will fade away, and it‚Äôll just be you and me. You in your beautiful red saari, looking like the most ethereal being I‚Äôve ever laid my eyes on, and me, trying to hold back tears because even then, I‚Äôll still be in awe that I get to call you mine forever.
And then there‚Äôs the dream of us as parents‚Äîa dream that makes me both nervous and incredibly excited. I imagine our kids running around the house, their laughter filling every corner. I imagine helping them make birthday cards for their mama, teaching them how to surprise you with flowers and little notes. I see us sitting together as a family, you at the center of it all, your smile brighter than anything else in the room.
Sabiha, I think about the little moments too‚Äîthe things that seem insignificant but mean everything to me. I dream of holding your hand while grocery shopping, sneaking kisses when no one‚Äôs looking, cooking dinner together (even if I burn everything), and dancing in the kitchen late at night. I dream of cuddling on the couch during rainy days, watching your favorite movies, and teasing you when you cry during the emotional parts.
I also dream of the quiet moments, the ones where we‚Äôre just sitting in comfortable silence, maybe reading or scrolling through our phones, but still feeling completely connected. I imagine us growing old together, the years adding silver to your hair and more reasons to love you to my heart. I imagine looking at you decades from now and still feeling the same butterflies I feel today.
And yet, Sabiha, I also think of the wild, unbridled passion that will always burn between us‚Äîbecause with you, I know it‚Äôll never fade. I dream of all the times we‚Äôll lose ourselves in each other, where nothing else will matter but the way your body moves against mine, the way you whisper my name in the softest, sweetest tone. I want to feel your warmth, over and over again, until we are breathless and content, tangled up in a love that feels like poetry written on skin. No matter how many years pass, I know I‚Äôll always crave you, always need you, always find my way back to you in the most intimate ways possible.
You‚Äôve given me so much to look forward to, Sabiha. Loving you has transformed every ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù into a ‚Äúwhen,‚Äù every uncertainty into a promise. You make me believe in a future that‚Äôs not just possible but magical‚Äîa future where every day feels like a gift because I get to spend it with you.
And, Sabiha, no matter what life throws at us, I want you to know that I‚Äôll be by your side, every step of the way. We‚Äôll face challenges together, celebrate victories together, and build something so beautiful that even time won‚Äôt be able to take it away.
You are my tomorrow, Sabiha. My dream, my hope, my everything. And as I write this, my heart swells with the thought of all the tomorrows we‚Äôll share‚Äîall the memories we‚Äôll create, the love we‚Äôll continue to nurture, and the life we‚Äôll build together.
I love you, Sabiha, more than words can ever express, and I can‚Äôt wait to spend every tomorrow proving it to you.




            <b>Chapter 15: Glaze De Ultima:</b>

I have written something for you. I call this 'glaze de ultima':
"By your side, it feels like I‚Äôve found something entirely different‚Äîa feeling that stands apart from anything I‚Äôve ever known. It feels like I could never let you go because, deep down, it seems like my future is intricately tied to you, and I wouldn‚Äôt want it any other way. I hope we can continue painting this masterpiece together, guiding the brush to create the most breathtaking art of our future. A story with no end, one where you and I, hand in hand, write each chapter, each line, and each word.  
With you, I feel something I‚Äôve never felt before. Something that feels like home, something that fills me with a happiness so profound that it‚Äôs almost impossible to put into words. Isn‚Äôt it extraordinary? I look up at the sky, and even the stars seem dim compared to the light in your eyes. I‚Äôve found everything I‚Äôve ever longed for by your side. My heart and soul seem forever drawn to you, seeking you out like a compass unerringly pointing north.  
You are perfect in my eyes‚Äîin all your quirks, imperfections, and every word you speak. The way you laugh, the way you move, and the way you simply exist make me adore you more deeply than I ever thought possible. I want to witness your growth, your triumphs, and even your moments of failure. To stand by you and celebrate every victory or weather every storm together. You‚Äôve trusted me, shared moments of your life with me‚Äîgood and bad‚Äîand I am beyond grateful to be here, to be yours, to simply *be*.  
Sabiha, you stand before me like a vision crafted by the heavens themselves, every detail so effortlessly radiant that it‚Äôs impossible to look away. Your beauty isn‚Äôt just skin deep‚Äîit‚Äôs a symphony of perfection, playing on every sense, lingering in every heartbeat. Your thick, curly hair cascades in waves like a dark waterfall kissed by moonlight. Each strand holds the kind of allure that poets would envy, a wild yet elegant frame for a face that belongs in dreams. Your bold, perfectly arched eyebrows add strength to your delicate features, framing those mesmerizing eyes‚Äîeyes that hold galaxies, deep and endless, full of stories untold and mysteries unspoken. Your button-like nose sits perfectly on your face, an irresistible combination of innocence and charm. And your lips‚Äîfull, soft, and temptingly kissable‚Äîare forever caught in the warmth of the sweetest blush, a shade of pink that seems to always stay flushed. When you smile, time itself seems to stop, your cheeks flushed with a rosy hue that could make the coldest winter feel like spring.
Your skin, fair and glowing, radiates warmth from within, soft to the touch and smoother than the finest silk. Your body, curvy in all the right ways, is the epitome of sensuality. Every curve tells a story of strength and softness, with slender arms, graceful hands, and legs that seem to go on forever‚Äîsexy, elegant, and undeniably alluring.
But it‚Äôs not just your physical beauty that captivates me‚Äîit‚Äôs the mind behind it all. A mind so sharp, so quick, and so full of life. Your wit, humor, and ability to see the world with such depth and kindness‚Äîit‚Äôs intoxicating. You are the perfect paradox of boldness and gentleness, of strength and vulnerability.
When you move, it‚Äôs as if the universe pauses to admire you. Every step you take is fluid and purposeful, every gesture so naturally graceful it feels rehearsed by the stars. You don‚Äôt just walk into a room; you own it, effortlessly commanding attention without ever trying.
You are my living masterpiece, my muse, my everything. Every curve, every thought, every glance‚Äîit all pulls me in, leaving me utterly spellbound. And yet, beyond your beauty, beyond your mind, is your soul. A soul so loving, so loyal, and so endlessly giving that it redefines what it means to love and be loved.
You are my everything‚Äîlike the sun, the air, the warmth on a cold winter‚Äôs night, or the chill that saves me on a scorching summer‚Äôs day. You are my comfort, the feeling of safety I get when I wrap myself in a blanket after watching a horror movie. You are my support when I‚Äôm at my lowest. You‚Äôre my home, my safe haven, my refuge.  
Every time you‚Äôre near, my heart seems to falter. Your every move slows my heartbeat to a rhythm so delicate it feels like it might stop altogether. You are the life I long to have, the soul that sustains me, the shimmering light in my darkest hours. Every moment with you feels like a prayer answered, every glance from you is worth scaling mountains for.  
You pull me in so many directions at once. My mind races, my heart pounds, and yet all I want is to be in your arms, wrapped in your warmth. The way you make me feel, Sabiha, I believe this is love. The purest, most overwhelming love.  
You are the storm I‚Äôd willingly walk into, the sun I‚Äôd burn to reach. If I could hold the stars themselves, they‚Äôd pale in comparison to the warmth of your presence. Even if you‚Äôre a horizon I‚Äôll never cross, I‚Äôd walk to the ends of the earth just to see you shine.  
You‚Äôre the ache in my chest when I breathe too deeply, the bittersweet pull of a melody I can‚Äôt stop replaying. The laughter we share, the challenges we face‚Äîeverything binds us together in this beautiful, chaotic dance of love.  
Every day, I wake up, and the first thing on my mind is you. Your beautiful curls, your radiant smile, your captivating eyes. Your voice echoes in my mind like a symphony, and every little moment we‚Äôve shared fills me with joy. I‚Äôve been falling for you every day for what feels like an eternity, and I hope that you feel the same, now and forever.  
You‚Äôre like an autumn sunrise, warm and comforting after a long, cold night. Even if love sometimes feels fragile, like it could fade with time, my love for you will always remain‚Äîa constant light, a home waiting with the porch light on. Even if the world feels like it‚Äôs pulling us apart, know that I‚Äôll always be here, holding on to the warmth we share.  
You are my sun, and I am your moon‚Äîdestined to follow you, to cherish your light, to love you endlessly, even from afar. No other star, no other light, could ever compare to the brilliance you‚Äôve brought into my life. You are my one and only, Sabiha, my beginning, my middle, and my end." 




            <b>Chapter 16: To the Queen of My Hearts</b>

Sabiha, my love, as I write this final chapter, my heart feels so full, yet I know there will never be enough words to capture everything I feel for you. This letter, these chapters‚Äîthey are just fragments of the endless love I hold for you. Each sentence is a piece of my soul, each word a reflection of how deeply you‚Äôve become a part of me.
When I think of us, Sabiha, I think of permanence. Not the fleeting, conditional kind of love people speak of, but a love that feels infinite‚Äîboundless, eternal, and unwavering. You are my forever, Sabiha. I see it in every corner of my heart, in every beat, every thought, every dream. You are my always.
You‚Äôve taught me what love truly means‚Äînot the kind seen in movies or read in books, but a love that feels real and raw, yet impossibly beautiful. A love that grows in the small moments: the quiet calls late at night, the way your voice softens when you‚Äôre teasing me, the way your laughter feels like music to my soul. You are the definition of love for me, and I am endlessly grateful that I get to feel this way about someone as extraordinary as you.
I promise you, Sabiha, that no matter where life takes us, I will always be here for you. Whether the days are bright or the storms roll in, I‚Äôll stand by you, unwavering and steady. You will never have to face anything alone because I will always be your partner, your confidant, your biggest supporter, and your forever love.
This is just conclusion to the letter, but never the conclusion of my love for you. As I sit here, putting together these words, my heart feels full, almost too full to write properly. Happy, happy, happiest birthday, my love. This is your day‚Äîthe day the world became brighter, the day the stars shone a little more, the day you came into existence and made everything more beautiful. This is the first birthday I get to celebrate with you, and to say it‚Äôs an honor feels like an understatement. It‚Äôs more than an honor‚Äîit‚Äôs a privilege, a joy, a dream come true.
Every moment I‚Äôve spent thinking about this letter, every sentence I‚Äôve written for you, it‚Äôs all been with one thing in mind: to make you feel as special as you truly are. Sabiha, you are extraordinary. You are a force of nature, a burst of light, a gentle warmth that makes life so much better just by being in it.
This is your 16th birthday‚Äîa milestone, a celebration of not just who you are now, but of everything you‚Äôve been and everything you‚Äôll become. When I look at you, Sabiha, I see someone who is growing into herself so gracefully. I see someone who is kind and loving, strong and resilient, beautiful inside and out. I see someone who inspires me every single day.
And as I think about this being your special day, I can‚Äôt help but feel overwhelmed by the memories we‚Äôve shared. This is our first birthday together, but it feels like I‚Äôve known you forever. I think about the way we started, the way we became ‚Äúus.‚Äù Do you remember how shy we were at first? How every conversation felt like walking on air? And now look at us‚Äîwe‚Äôve built something so strong, so real, so full of love that it takes my breath away.
I‚Äôve been so lucky to be part of your life, to see you grow and thrive, to see your smile light up every room you walk into. Sabiha, you are everything I‚Äôve ever wanted and so much more. You‚Äôve shown me what it means to love and be loved. You‚Äôve taught me patience, kindness, and how to be a better person. And for that, I will always, always be grateful.
This letter isn‚Äôt just a gift‚Äîit‚Äôs a celebration of you, of us, of everything we‚Äôve built together and everything we will build in the future. It‚Äôs a reflection of all the love I hold for you, all the admiration I have for who you are.
You are the reason I believe in magic, the reason I believe in forever. You are the one I want to spend my life with, the one I want to wake up to every morning and fall asleep next to every night. You are my partner, my best friend, my everything.
And today, on your birthday, I want you to know just how much you mean to me. I want you to feel every bit of the love and adoration I have for you. Because you, Sabiha, deserve the world.
I know life isn‚Äôt always perfect, and neither are we. But that‚Äôs the beauty of it, isn‚Äôt it? That through all the ups and downs, through all the challenges and joys, we‚Äôve chosen each other. And I will continue to choose you, every single day, for the rest of my life.
As you step into this new year of your life, I hope you carry with you the knowledge that you are loved beyond measure. That you are cherished and adored in ways words can‚Äôt fully capture. I hope this year brings you all the happiness, success, and love you deserve.
I know we‚Äôve talked about the future, about what it might look like, about the dreams we share. And I want you to know that no matter what, I‚Äôm here for you. I‚Äôm here to support you, to cheer you on, to stand by your side as we navigate life together.
So here‚Äôs to you, my love. Here‚Äôs to 16 years of you, and to all the years to come. Here‚Äôs to the laughter we‚Äôve shared, the moments we‚Äôve cherished, the memories we‚Äôve made. Here‚Äôs to the love we‚Äôve built, the bond we‚Äôve created, the life we‚Äôre building together.
Happy birthday, Sabiha. Thank you for being you, for being the most incredible person I‚Äôve ever known. Thank you for loving me, for believing in me, for standing by me. Thank you for making my life so much brighter, so much fuller, so much more beautiful.
I love you more than words can ever express. I love you with all my heart, with all my soul, with every part of me. And I will continue to love you, today and always.
This is your day, Sabiha. Celebrate it, enjoy it, live it to the fullest. And know that I am here, always, loving you, supporting you, and cheering you on.
Happy, happy, happiest birthday, my love. Here‚Äôs to you.
With all my love,
Your precious boy,
Farhan üïä
